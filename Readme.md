# Training and Optimizing Foundation Models with Custom Adaptation

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to train and optimize lightweight foundation models using PyTorch and Hugging Face, incorporating Triton for kernel optimization. The model is adapted to a specific domain, such as healthcare, finance, or legal documents.

## Features

- **Dataset Preparation**: Efficiently load and preprocess domain-specific datasets.
- **Model Training**: Fine-tune pre-trained models like BERT or GPT-2 for specific tasks.
- **Triton Optimization**: Implement custom Triton kernels to enhance training efficiency.
- **Evaluation**: Assess model performance using relevant metrics.
- **Open-Source Ready**: Well-documented codebase with tutorials and performance benchmarks.
